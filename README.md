# Move Up

This is a project for the Advanced Programming discipline at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).
Move Up is a platform to find and schedule group sports activities. The intended final product could have a matchmaking system for pairing players in a soccer match, for example. This project was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
For now, this application is capable of:
* Create an Event
* Delete an existing Event
* Sign in for an Event
* Show participants signed in for an existing Event
